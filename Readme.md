### Pseudo 3D demo

It's basically a port of SockPop Collective's demo of a 3d scene in 2d engine.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chtRPC1ISyA this is a video this project is based of.

Original was written in GameMaker, I rewrote it using Ebitengine. Check out 
the original demo and look at original source code here: https://sokpop.itch.io/sokpop-fake-3d-demo
